zemaxglass
==========

A suite of utilities for analyzing optical glasses using the Zemax glass library, released as open source under the MIT/X license.

For instructions and examples on how to use the code, see the user guide PDF.

Notebooks
=========
Jupyter notebooks illustrating usage are provided in the Notebooks folder. However, the notebooks are distributed in markdown (.md) format and the [Juptext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) package must be installed to read them and convert to .ipynb format.

Other Requirements
==================
The label overlap problem in certain glass map plots can be mitigated using the [adjustText](https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText) package.
