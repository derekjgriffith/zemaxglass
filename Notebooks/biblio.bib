  abstract     = {Brittle materials such as glass do not possess a single characteristic strength.  The strength of the material is dependent on the distribution of cracks or surface flaws. These factors, coupled with the inherent brittleness (cause of catastrophic or rapid failure) mean that extremely conservative design approaches are typically used for optical elements made of glass. Determining a design allowable for glass elements is critical for optical systems using relatively brittle glass types or for optical elements subject to relatively high stress levels.  Rule-of-thumb tensile design strengths are typically at 1000 - 1500 psi for nominal glass materials. This neglects the specific glass composition, subcritical crack growth, surface area under stress, and nature of the load - static or cyclic. Several methods to characterize the strength of optical glass are discussed to aid engineers in predicting a design strength for a given surface finish, glass type, and environment.  These include estimating fracture toughness for a given glass, predicting inert strength using material test data, and lifetime predictions accounting for static fatigue and cyclic loading.  Determining a design strength for a spaceborne optical element is discussed.},

  abstract  = {The development of high-energy lasers has focused attention on the requirement to assess the mechanical strength of optical components made of fused silica or fused quartz (SiO2). The strength of this material is known to be highly dependent on the stressed area and the surface finish, but has not yet been properly characterized in the published literature. Recently, Detrio and collaborators at the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) performed extensive ring-on-ring flexural strength measurements on fused SiO2 specimens ranging in size from 1  to  9  in. in diameter and of widely differing surface qualities. We report on a Weibull statistical analysis of the UDRI data-an analysis based on the procedure outlined in Proc. SPIE 4375, 241 (2001). We demonstrate that (1) a two-parameter Weibull model, including the area-scaling principle, applies; (2) the shape parameter (m10) is essentially independent of the stressed area as well as the surface finish; and (3) the characteristic strength (1-cm2 uniformly stressed area) obeys a linear law, C (in megapascals) 160−2.83× (in parts per million per steradian), where  characterizes the surface/subsurface "damage" of an appropriate set of test specimens. In this light, we evaluate the cumulative failure probability and the failure probability density of polished and superpolished fused SiO2 windows as a function of the biaxial tensile stress, for stressed areas ranging from 0.3  to  100  cm2.},

  abstractnote = {This work explores quick predictive methods for calculating potentially risky stresses in cemented doublets underdoing temperature change that agree well with finite element analysis. We also provide guidelines for avoiding stress concentrations. Cemented doublets are ubiquitous in the optics world, but it is not always clear if they will perform as intended in a specific thermal environment due to excessive stress. The stress in the optic can cause debonding or even fracture. Yoder addressed this problem using analytical results from Chen and Nelson but also expressed some skepticism as to the accuracy and usefulness of those results. Closed-form analytical solutions are extremely useful when doing trade-off studies to see if a particular geometry or glass choice will cause stress problems. The problem of bonded materials undergoing temperature change is of great interest in the electronics industry, and improved analytical solutions are now available that address the issues raised by Yoder, and they have been validated using finite element analysis (FEA). But the newer solutions still have limitations. The analytical solutions presented here cannot predict stresses due to stress concentrations or singularities at the edge of the bondline—this still has to be done using FEA—although some advanced methods are available. Also, the existing analytical methods assume a flat interface between adjoining elements; they do not account for the effect of curvature. We find that most doublet failures start at the edges and involve debonding of the glass. Glass fracture is rare for doublets, accounting for less than 10% of the failures. This paper provides the reader with a general introduction to a large and dense body of literature in order to demystify the subject of temperature-induced glass bonding failures.},

of aberration formulas might be effective for some simple optical systems, it has limitations for complex and fast systems. For this
reason chromatic aberration correction is usually accomplished with real ray tracing. However, existing optimization tools in lens
design software typically mix the correction ofmonochromatic and chromatic aberrations by construction of an error function that
minimizes both aberrations at the same time.This mixingmakes the correction of one aberration type dependent on the correction
of the other aberration type. We show two methods to separate the chromatic aberrations correction of a lens system. In the first
method we use forward and reverse ray tracing and fictitious nondispersive glasses, to cancel themonochromatic aberrationcontent
and allow the ray tracing optimization to focus mainly on the color correction. On the second method we provide the algorithm
for an error function that separates aberrations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how these ray tracing methods can be applied
to athermalize an optical system.We are unaware that these simple but effective methods have been already discussed in detail by
other authors.},

  abstract    = {An innovative, evolvable hardware method for the automatic design of optical
systems is presented and verified. The proposed method is based on a multiobjective
memetic optimization algorithm. The multi-objective approach
simultaneously, but separately, addresses the image quality, tolerance, and
complexity of the system. The memetic technique breaks down the search for
optical designs in three different parts or phases: optical glass selection,
exploration, and exploitation. The optical glass selection phase is based on the
unification of two previously published methods with new contributions to repair
practical implementation issues and incorporates a multi-objective approach.
This new glass selection method supports the choice of the most appropriate
set of glasses for the system under design. The glass selection phase limits the
available glasses from hundreds to just a few, drastically reducing the design
space and significantly increasing the efficiency of the automatic design
method. The exploration phase is based on an evolutionary algorithm (EA),
more specifically, on a problem-tailored generalized extremal optimization
(GEO) algorithm named optical GEO (O-GEO). The new EA incorporates many
features customized for lens design such as optical system codification and
diversity operands. The non-dominated systems found in the exploration phase
are refined by a local search based on the damped least square method in the
exploitation phase. As a result, the method returns a set of non-dominated
solutions generating a Pareto front. Our method resulted in alternative and
useful insights about the trade-off solutions for a lens design problem. The
efficiency of the proposed method is verified through examples, showing
excellent results for both simple systems and real-world problems.},

  abstract  = {For more than 400 years, optical glass has provided mankind with a window into both the hidden microcosm and vast outer cosmos of the known universe, transforming philosophy, science, and engineering through its visage and, thus, shaping modern civilization. Its high transmittance, homogeneity, and precisely defined light refraction properties are the preconditions for highly resolved true-color imaging, making it an intrinsic component of technology in general. From consumer products, such as cameras and binoculars, to microscopes and telescopes—the most essential tools of research in many fields—the role of optical glass is integral to the very foundations of modern science and industry.

In contrast to its fundamental importance, there is often a lack of knowledge regarding the properties of optical glass by engineers and designers, causing misunderstandings in purchasing and fabrication, and ultimately limiting the potential and application of this dynamic material. This book will serve as an invaluable resource of technical information, including the index of refraction and its dependence on wavelength (dispersion), optical homogeneity and transmittance (presented together with restrictions imposed by the manufacturing processes and chemical resistance), as well as mechanical, thermal, and environmental properties. Measurement methods with their achievable accuracy are given, along with a wide scope of overview diagrams illustrating properties and main uses, as well as diagrams ranking optical glass types with respect to their properties. The wide scope and lucid organization of this volume will prove to be highly valuable across a wide range of design, engineering, and purchasing applications within the many fields dependent on this incredible material.},
